## Game Description

The game displays cards that are randomly shuffled. A move counter, a timer and a star rating are present on the page. A player starts the game by flipping over the cards trying to match them by pair. Anytime two cards are clicked, one move is made and is registered by the move counter. The game is won once all cards have been successfully matched. At that moment, a popup appears on the page congratulating the player and detailing the time spent, the star rating and how many moves were made. A reset button allows the player to reset the game and play again if desired.
